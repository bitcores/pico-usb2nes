# pico-usb2nes Reference PCB
This directory contains reference a PCB design for the pico-usb2nes. It has not been designed by a experienced engineer, but it DOES work.

If you have some experience designing circuits like this, I would very much welcome improved designs.

For the reference design you will need:
* 1x Waveshare compatible RP2040-Zero
* 1x diode (I am using a 1N5819, 1N5817 better)
* 1x USB A type female port
* 2x 22ohm resistors
* 1x 100uf 16v capacitor (input from console)
* 1x four-channel logic level converter
* 1x NES controller port (PCB mountable)
* 5x pin headers (optional for i2c)

[This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve_WcSxNZzQ) goes over the components and assembly.

These NES controller ports can be kinda hard to find, I will include a link to one source below but it may become unavailable
